I am a software craftsman, always trying to increase and improve both my understanding of the things we build as well as my ability to communicate those understandings.

I have worn many labels, including...

*   Developer (Junior, Senior, Java, Web, Automation, ...)
*   <span style="line-height:1.5;">Leader (Team, Technical, Project, ...)</span>
*   <span style="line-height:1.5;">Designer</span>
*   Architect
*   Tester
I always wear aspects of these responsibilities regardless of formal title.

I aim to follow these practices:

*   [Principles of Software Craftsmanship](http://www.8thlight.com/principles)
*   [Context Driven Testing](http://context-driven-testing.com/)
*   [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) (but not necessarily Agile/Scrum Process)
