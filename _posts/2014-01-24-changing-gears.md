My first week in, and I am being exposed to my team mates' interests.

My cube mate has done some great things to make front-end automation tools available to all developers on the floor. Coming from the dev group myself, I know that this has been a coveted possibility for many years. Now it is just a matter of letting everyone know it exists, hand holding a bit on creating their own first scripts, and then watching as opportunities and future possibilities unfold :)

Another member of the testing team is investigating API testing. We're collaborating to define a strategy. We've [read this checklist](http://www.testinggeek.com/testing-restful-webservices-or-api-testing-remember-papas-be-sfo-deed-help-gc-and-dvla-pc) for inspiration, and we're being vigilant for aspects that could be checked with automation. An API seem like a natural fit for **Functional** checks, seeing as the longterm actor for it is another inhuman system. Lots of items from that checklist require human interaction and interpretation (especially in the **Consumable** category). I am unsure of how to test something like _ease of use_ of an API that has hundred of end points and variations on each of those. Then again, I suppose the answer is in the question: if it is so large it has become daunting it might inherently not be easy to use...

Lots of thinking going on, and lots of passionate people. I look forward to the surprises next week may entail.
