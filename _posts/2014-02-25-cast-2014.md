On my first day in my new job, my boss threw out a challenge to me: submit a proposal to [CAST](http://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/conference/cast-2014/) for a conference talk I could give. The submission due date was is 42 hours...

CAST  is the annual Conference for the [Association of Software Testing](http://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/). It does not align with my typical impression of conferences: payed for by industry corporations, presenters with hidden agendas to line their pockets, and a general feeling of a shark-tank with chum. Instead, to me it sounds more like a University type of conference: sessions meant for discussion and growth for both the attendees and the presenter, and not linked directly to profits.

So, back to my challenge. I succeeded at selecting a topic of interest to me and outlining enough information that I believe I could grow it into a 40 minute presentation. I wrote up a proposal and emailed it into the cyber-nether.

My letter made it to [Bernie Berger](http://www.testassured.com/) &amp; [Paul Holland](http://testingthoughts.com/), the co-chairs of the conference. And most surprising to me, I have been selected to present this August in New York City!

It is a big responsibility, and definitely an honour to have been selected. I have a lot of work ahead for creating an engaging and educational presentation that is worthy of the time of my peers.

It will a first for me in many regards: trip to NY, attending a conference in my profession, presenting to a crowd outside of my employer, planning and booking travel to the United States of America, preparing myself for my first encounter with the TSA scanners... :)
