<p>On my first day in my new job, my boss threw out a challenge to me: submit a proposal to <a href="http://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/conference/cast-2014/">CAST</a> for a conference talk I could give. The submission due date was is 42 hours...</p>
<p>CAST  is the annual Conference for the <a href="http://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/">Association of Software Testing</a>. It does not align with my typical impression of conferences: payed for by industry corporations, presenters with hidden agendas to line their pockets, and a general feeling of a shark-tank with chum. Instead, to me it sounds more like a University type of conference: sessions meant for discussion and growth for both the attendees and the presenter, and not linked directly to profits.</p>
<p>So, back to my challenge. I succeeded at selecting a topic of interest to me and outlining enough information that I believe I could grow it into a 40 minute presentation. I wrote up a proposal and emailed it into the cyber-nether.</p>
<p>My letter made it to <a href="http://www.testassured.com/">Bernie Berger</a> &amp; <a href="http://testingthoughts.com/">Paul Holland</a>, the co-chairs of the conference. And most surprising to me, I have been selected to present this August in New York City!</p>
<p>It is a big responsibility, and definitely an honour to have been selected. I have a lot of work ahead for creating an engaging and educational presentation that is worthy of the time of my peers.</p>
<p>It will a first for me in many regards: trip to NY, attending a conference in my profession, presenting to a crowd outside of my employer, planning and booking travel to the United States of America, preparing myself for my first encounter with the TSA scanners... :)</p>
