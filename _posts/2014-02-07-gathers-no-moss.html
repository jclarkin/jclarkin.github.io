<p>This week the team said farewell to a valuable teacher: <a href="http://testingthoughts.com/">Paul Holland</a>. He had joined us for a fixed duration to learn who we are, share his observations and teach his knowledge. I am glad to have met him, and hope to continue to learn from not just his experiences but those of his fellow <a href="http://context-driven-testing.com/">Context-Driven</a> Testers.</p>
<p>In other news... the automation stone is rolling downhill gathering speed. We have offered to train others in using <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> to author automated Web scripts. After talking to fellow members of the department, we have thirty interested individuals (including some managers)!</p>
<p>We're going about the training in a new way for us, as a conversation and improv demo. Most meetings would have been a room of 30 people staring at a power point presentation for an hour. Instead we will host a group of five at a time and ask them what they already know, what they want to know, and show them how we might solve a similar situation using Selenium. I think it will be fun even though the first one will be uncomfortable as it is a new experience :)</p>
<p>Late in the week, my partner in automation research and I were inspired: why not use <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a> to render information about Domain Model of a product? For <a href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a> functional checks, we could surface the results by Entity of a product to help owners prioritize deeper analysis. This tool is going well, and hopefully this month we can share it with the community :P</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exciting times.</p>
