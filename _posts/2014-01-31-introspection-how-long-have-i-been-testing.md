I have played the role of **Developer** for the better part of a decade. During that time, the concept of testing has been present but ancillary to creating _new things_.

Now that I am changing my focus to be a tester and refining my understanding of the nuances of this large domain... I am starting to wonder: have I always been a tester? Maybe yes, but neither consciously aware of it nor a very good one at that.

Now may be a good time to inject some core testing definitions (courtesy of [Bolton &amp; Bach](http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/856)):

> **Testing**_ is the process of evaluating a product by learning about it through experimentation, which includes to some degree: questioning, study, modeling, observation and inference._
> **Checking**_ is the process of making evaluations by applying algorithmic decision rules to specific observations of a product._

# Check it out

As a developer, checking has explicitly been part of my responsibilities.

[more, JUnit, maintainable &amp; understandable code, information to future self or others]

[managing JUnit pass rates, performing scripted tests at release]

[Sonar, architecture, code rules, process of code reviews, ...]

# Test the waters

[questioning and learning]

[designer, UX, architecture]
