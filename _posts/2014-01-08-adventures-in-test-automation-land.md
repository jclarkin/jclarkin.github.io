[Note: The term "Automated Test" is slowly being pushed to a simplified rename as "Check". This is being put forward by the software testing community to disambiguate between the less intelligent verification done by a machine vs. the intuitive and engaged verification that is only achievable via organic minds.]

Starting this month, I shall be adopting a new role as a test automation tools developer. What this means is that I will be exploring and analyzing areas for automation. I will research tools and &#124; or build frameworks to facilitate software verification.

I am hoping to log my learning and growth on this voyage, and welcome feedback from the community at large. "Fail early - Fail often" is a great mantra to self-development, and only by exposing my ignorance can such opportunities occur :)
