This week the team said farewell to a valuable teacher: [Paul Holland](http://testingthoughts.com/). He had joined us for a fixed duration to learn who we are, share his observations and teach his knowledge. I am glad to have met him, and hope to continue to learn from not just his experiences but those of his fellow [Context-Driven](http://context-driven-testing.com/) Testers.

In other news... the automation stone is rolling downhill gathering speed. We have offered to train others in using [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) to author automated Web scripts. After talking to fellow members of the department, we have thirty interested individuals (including some managers)!

We're going about the training in a new way for us, as a conversation and improv demo. Most meetings would have been a room of 30 people staring at a power point presentation for an hour. Instead we will host a group of five at a time and ask them what they already know, what they want to know, and show them how we might solve a similar situation using Selenium. I think it will be fun even though the first one will be uncomfortable as it is a new experience :)

Late in the week, my partner in automation research and I were inspired: why not use [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) to render information about Domain Model of a product? For [JUnit](http://junit.org/) functional checks, we could surface the results by Entity of a product to help owners prioritize deeper analysis. This tool is going well, and hopefully this month we can share it with the community :P

Exciting times.
