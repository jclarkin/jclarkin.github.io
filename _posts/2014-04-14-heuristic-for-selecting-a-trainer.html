<p>When looking at a potential coach or teacher, I find myself often using the following criteria to help me make a selection.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Openness</strong>: Do they expose their ideas and opinions in public forums? Do they allow discourse and feedback on their material, or is it a one-way channel?</li>
<li><strong>Prior Art</strong>: Research material authored by the coach: articles, blog posts, videos, code, tweets, publications. Are ideas clearly expressed and compatible to your mode of learning?</li>
<li><strong>Bias</strong>: Do they present multiple facets to ideas? Is there personal incentive for endorsing one idea over another?</li>
<li><strong>Interpersonal</strong>: The "Play nice with others" factor. How to they behave in a group? Do they foster relationships and enable growth? Do they advocate for peers in their profession?</li>
<li><strong>Referral</strong>: Use your network of both people you know or online personas you respect and see if any of them approve or refer to the trainer or their material.</li>
<li><strong>Experience</strong>: Review the individual's listed skills, credentials, and experience. Can you trust them to bring authentic information that you believe applies to your needs?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a comprehensive lists (all models are flawed). What questions do you ask yourself when evaluating potential mentors, coaches, trainers, or teachers?</p>
