<p>I have played the role of <strong>Developer</strong> for the better part of a decade. During that time, the concept of testing has been present but ancillary to creating <em>new things</em>.</p>
<p>Now that I am changing my focus to be a tester and refining my understanding of the nuances of this large domain... I am starting to wonder: have I always been a tester? Maybe yes, but neither consciously aware of it nor a very good one at that.</p>
<p>Now may be a good time to inject some core testing definitions (courtesy of <a href="http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/856">Bolton &amp; Bach</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Testing</strong><em> is the process of evaluating a product by learning about it through experimentation, which includes to some degree: questioning, study, modeling, observation and inference.</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Checking</strong><em> is the process of making evaluations by applying algorithmic decision rules to specific observations of a product.</em></p></blockquote>
<h1>Check it out</h1>
<p>As a developer, checking has explicitly been part of my responsibilities.</p>
<p>[more, JUnit, maintainable &amp; understandable code, information to future self or others]</p>
<p>[managing JUnit pass rates, performing scripted tests at release]</p>
<p>[Sonar, architecture, code rules, process of code reviews, ...]</p>
<h1>Test the waters</h1>
<p>[questioning and learning]</p>
<p>[designer, UX, architecture]</p>
