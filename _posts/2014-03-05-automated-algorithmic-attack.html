<p>Creating a suite of checks</p>
<p>Creating API checks tied to fuzzy inputs to allow for dynamic creation</p>
<p>Pattern watching test failures/success for Baysian probabilities</p>
<p>Attacking (testing) the APIs based on the machine learning to determine if the failure is systemic</p>
<p>Evolutionary algorithms to avoid local maximas of failure opportunities</p>
